# MRE134

MRE134_Stiffness3D is a zipped NifTi file that corresponds to the average shear stiffness (kPa) from 134 young adult participants in MNI space (91 x 109 x 91)

MRE134_Damping3D is a zipped NifTi file that corresponds to the average damping ratio (dimensionless) of the brain from 134 young adult participants in MNI space (91 x 109 x 91)

MRE134_Stiffness4D is a 4D zipped NifTi file that contains the warped shear stiffness (kPa) of each participant in MNI space (91 x 109 x 91 x 134)

MRE134_Damping4D is a 4D zipped NifTi file that contains the warped damping ratio of each participant in MNI space (91 x 109 x 91 x 134)

Demographic data from each participant is also provided as an excel file.
