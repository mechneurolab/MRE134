# MRE134

MRE_134_Mu_3D is a zipped NifTi file that corresponds to the average shear stiffness (kPa) of the brain from 134 young adult participants (91 x 109 x 91)

MRE_134_Xi_3D is a zipped NifTi file that corresponds to the average damping ratio (dimensionless) of the brain from 134 young adult participants (91 x 109 x 91)

MRE_134_Mu_4D is a 4D zipped NifTi file that contains the warped shear stiffness (kPa) of each participant in MNI space (91 x 109 x 91 x 134)

MRE_134_Xi_4D is a 4D zipped NifTi file that contains the warped damping ratio of each participant in MNI space(91 x 109 x 91 x 134)
